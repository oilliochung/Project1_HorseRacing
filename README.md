# WebScraping_HorseRacingEDA_from_HKJockeyClub 

This project is to scape data from Hong Kong Jockey Club website and do EDA analysis to seek win opportunity on horse racing.

# Data 
  - Webscrpae all horse racing data of 2019-2020 (1 season) from Hong Kong Jockey Club website
  - Include 10207 race results, 1417 horses, 50 jockeys, 40 trainers.

# Conclusion
  - Jockey is a more important factor than trainer
  - Factors of country of origin and weight of horse etc. also matter
  - Narrow down by Ignoring the Jockeys and Trainers with middle win rate
  - Don't believe in conventional wisdom

# Challenge
  - Different webiste layouts in different pages which make webscraping fail, debug, and rerun
  - Hard to find useful insight in few days
  - Require domain expertise in horse racing.

# Next Step
  - Build machine learning model
  - Study not only buying Wins but also other betting methods such as Places
  - Involve more data from previous seasons.
